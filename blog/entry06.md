# Entry 6
##### 5/28/24

### EDP
I am on step 8 of the engineering design process where I'm communicating the result by showing what I've made to people in my class and other SEP students. With this, I have gone through the entire EDP. 

### Skills
Some skills I've improved from this project was time management, I had to get my project to be presentation standards which meant I had to spend the entire week prior on the adding the beyond MvP features that I had planned but never gotten to.
