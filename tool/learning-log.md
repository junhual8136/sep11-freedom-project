* I had no clue how to start until I watched a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdXcD9X4NrQ)
* I set up a config file with a scene, and now I'm learning all the functions from the documentation

* Set up a basic kaboom (config)[https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup], (canvas)[https://kaboomjs.com/#kaboom], and (plugins)[https://github.com/notnullgames/tiled-kaboom]
* attempted to load tilemap with the plugin
* attempted to create a sprite and load it into the canvas
